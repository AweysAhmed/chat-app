## Chat app

This chat app focues on this Back-End features:
1. As a consumer of the API, I can persist my chat messages
2. As a consumer of the API, I can persist messages in specific channels I join.
3. As a consumer of the API, I can see the list of all the available channels

I selected the above features because they are the core features of a chat app and I believe they demonstarte my ability to learn and setup an app using features that I have not used before. (ActionCable and Stimulus)

I added controller tests as well as relevant Model tests using Minitest. I used ActionCable and Stimiulus because I have not used those in the past and wanted to practice using them. 

If I had more time, I would:
1. Add the ability to direct message users
2. Add more tests as I added more features
3. Add the ability to make video calls
